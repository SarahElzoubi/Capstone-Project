10. Challenges : 
       
    ‚Ä¢ Sign up page form wouldn't take margin-bottom ( too stuck on the bottom of the screen) , cliche but sometimes we all struggle with centreing a div 

    ‚Ä¢ Styling Django's sign up messages and error messages 

    ‚Ä¢ Styling Django's login error messages 
      
    ‚Ä¢ Moods to select multiple without JS.

    ‚Ä¢ Including a js function that renders 4 pics in the About. HTML template /page -> took a lot of time I just forgot to put the script in the header.
      
    ‚Ä¢ Redundant CSS tags in some big CSS files and overriding problem , fixed it by going through the code and reorganizing the classes.

 11. Future Work:

    ‚Ä¢ Profile : edit profile button (Update Profile)
      Include a profile model (User:1-1:Profile) where , user can upload their profile pic into.
      
    ‚Ä¢ Including a contact us model where the user can contact us via a message request  and they would get a notification in the nav bar ( notification section) User: 1-many requests 
      
    ‚Ä¢ Add a Search bar to search for journals faster

    ‚Ä¢ More animation with js 

    ‚Ä¢ Including an AI powered chat bot 

    ‚Ä¢ Future future : include psychologists and chat with them via text and maybe via video call for free.
